XII INTRODUCTION.

This word, so far removed from classical Latin, and so nearly
approaching to modern forms of language is very characteristic of
Wyclif.

Compare 3, 223 11, 153 11, 183 12, 12 and many following
passages. To avoid being tedious, I will cite only a few more
passages in confirmation of what has been said.

The quotation from Augustine 4, ‘21 ff. will answer our purpose.
In A such faults as loquemur (5, 5) caused by the mere misplacement
of a stroke, and the omission of the second in (5, 8), which is
often done by Wielif himself in a similar connexion, — are very
common and of minor importance. The other MSS. on the other
hand give about fifteen variants, and all differing from the text of A.
These of course cannot be treated separately here.

However, we cannot insist too strongly, upon the danger of
depending blindly upon A for the construction of our text.

We say nothing of minor mistakes such as in 9, ‘20 the omission
of ad, or worse 9, ‘23 reliccionem, assumere instead of resolucionem
and reassmnere, or 13, 23 the omission of et and simul.

XVhere all the other MSS. give a clear meaning as against A,
A must be rejected. This in the case in 14, 4 where the words of
Aristotle can be translated only intelleqcre aedificare vel texere but
where A, contrary to all the other MSS. inserts the meaningless
words, demere edicere.

Not to linger too long over this part of the subject I will
conclude it by summing up the principles which have been followed
in restoring this text:

1. Each Codex desei-ves eareful and independent consideration,
as a stemma or connexion between the MSS. could not be traced.

2. MS. A has given the most probable readings of test passages.

3. For this reason the preference in doubtful passages has
been given to A.

4. But arguing from the first principle l have just laid down,
it is possible, and even likely, that in some doubtful passages the
original text may be represented by B. C. P. or Pr.

0111· metliod of reconstructing the text will be further justified
by applying, as we proceed to do, the tests of the “higher criti-
eism''.
