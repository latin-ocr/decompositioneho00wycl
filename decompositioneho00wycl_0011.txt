INTRODUCTION.

The present volume of the Latin works of the proto-
reformer — the first purely philosophical writing in a Wiclifian
sense —— appears considerably later than was at first announced
by the Wiclif Society. ἡ

To explain this delay and perhaps to excuse it, a few words
may fairly be said on the difficulties of editing similar texts,
especially the philosophical writings of our author. These difficulties
are essentially involved in the principles adhered to in bringing out
this volume.

The principles which must guide our editors are well understood:
the volumes which have already appeared have helped to vdevelope
them3 and it might seem that a close following of the excellent
examples before me would have considerably facilitated my own
work. But anyone who set to work under this impression to edit
the philosophical opuscula of Wielif, would very soon find himself
undeceived. On Wiclif's theology we are on the whole fairly well
informed. Of his philosophy, even the pioneer works of Prantl and
Lechler give us but scanty indications.

As however the better known theologica] system of the gifted
Oxford master can be fully unfolded and made clear solely by the
publication of the whole of his obscure Latin writings, much more
can the basis of a sound study of Wiclifian philosophy be laid
when all the purely philosophical works of our author, which must
surely explain and complement one another, arc in like manner
made accessiblc to us. And this bears very closely upon the
present edition.
