XIV INTRODUCTION.

I confess to having found the verifying of these quotations
the most tedicus and laborious part of my work.

The reader who finds references in the notes for every quo-
tation from Augustine and Aristone, and confusions and misquo·
tations corrected, can hardly imagine the expenditure of time,
labour and patience, which all this involved.

&Vhole books and treatises had to be read through, in order
to discover any possible relation to Wiclif. My pains have been
so far rewarded, that every source possibly or probably used by
Wiclif has been discovered.

For the verification of the last-quoted passage from Averroes¹
Ι am greatly obliged to Professor Freudenthal of Breslau.

One passage only has completely baffled me: — the quotation
on the first page froin “Prologus δί Naturalium”. For this I have
searched in vain for weeks and months.

I have looked through everything in Vienna, I have written
to scholars in Leipzig, Berlin, Bonn, London and Oxford, without
being able to obtain or discover the information I required.

May all who find this edition wanting in some respects bear
these difficulties in mind.

For quotations from fathers of the church, Migne's reprint
was used, for Aristotle the large Paris edition (Didot), as these
editions are convenient for use, and are those most generally read,
as I have found.

The passages from Aristotle have been given from the original
text3 this has been necessary from the ambiguity of the Latin

version followed by Wiclif.
These sources after all form the real basis of the treatise, as

we shall see still more plainly further on. But it is evident from
the first, that this material has not been sufficiently digested to
work into a systennatic whole, neither is its application in detail
satisfactory.

Wiclif is clearest at the beginning, where the argument and
terminology are borrowed froin Scripture.

But later on we find a definition after Augustine, of Spiritus
and its various meanings in the Scripture3 ep. ad Pasc. II, 15
(page 1115, 21 of our edition) which clearly ought to have followed
