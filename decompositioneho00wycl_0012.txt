VI INTRODUCTION.

It is still too early to venture upon any but a very general
criticism of the tractate ‘de composicione’. It is only one of the many
building—stones of the Wiclifian system which is to be constructed,
we may hope, ere long.

I have made a special study of the philosophical treatises,
and Ι hope that a survey of the whole Wiclifian philosophy will
finish this part of the complete works.

With greater confidence, though not, as we shall see, without
difficulties to be superseded, I proceed to treat the external details
of the present edition. In this part of my work, I have been
mainly guided by my predecessors. Following the order observed
by them I shall briefly treat I. The manuscripts. II. The ‘diplomatic'
criticism. III. The higher criticism. IV. The question of genuineness.
V. The intrinsic value of the present volume.
