ADDENDA.

 

To 99, 12. Respecting the meaning of the word ‘Sor' which
I could find neither in the works of Wiclif published hitherto nor
in any compendia accessible to me, I received during the printing
of “de composicione'' an obliging communication from the Rev.
P. Heinrich Denifle.

He explains it as meaning ‘Socrates' and believes that this
name is applied generically in the scholastic dialect to any person
whatever.

This explanation is confirmed by a passage I have found in
the Codex of the Archivo de la corona de Aragon at Barcelona
Ripoll 84 Fol. ‘21¹'a ‘Tot prepositiones que Sor scit, Plato scit’ where
it is hardly possible that any other than Socrates can be brought
into connexion with Plato.

As this singular word does not occur in the works of Wielif
which have already been published7 I insert here those passages
where it occurs in the treatise Quaestiones Zoyicae et philosophicae
(the whole of which I have copied):

1. Corrolarium seeundum: Non oportet, si sor semper habet
liberum arbitrium, qaod semper habeat rectitudinem voluntatis. Probatur,
qaia stat sortem vel aliam racionalem creaturam habere liberum
arbitrium absente rectitudine, sicut stat aliquem habere visum, quo est

visurus montem vel solem, absente sole.
Cod. Prag. V. E. 14.7 Quest. ΙΙΙ. (F. 186³).

2. Ibid. At the end of Quest. IX . . . .. nullus (intellectus)
potest concipere, nisi sint ydee in mente divina, que ponuntur relaciones
ad extra ad res sive essencias, ωιτη necessario tempus, mundus, locus,
substancia vel accidens, homo, sor, animalitas sint possibilia a
primo ente . . .
