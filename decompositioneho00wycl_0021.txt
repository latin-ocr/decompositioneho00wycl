INTRODUCTION. XV

upon the words: ‘Loquendo itaque cle anima humana oportet eac fide
scripture supponere ipsam esse spiritum creatum mole indivisibilem et
incorruptibilem, possibilem per se esse ut anqelus’ (3, 24).

The same disregard for the plan laid down in the introduction
is seen in the long disquisition on homo interior and eoi-terior
introduced in page 109. This ought surely to have been mentioned
in the scheme, more especially as it was suggested by the words
of Augustine (5, 14).

Ι may be told that it is not for me to dispute with the author
about the arrangement of his work.

But what is to be said when Wielif, after having spoken of
the anima (see above), as incorruptibilis possibilis per se esse ut
anqelus, proceeds to say (speaking of the Aristotelian theory of the
soul) “ Unde non requiritur (557 13) aliquod liqamentum, liquns animum
cum corpore sicut requireretur, si anima esset res, que posset per se
eoeistere⁷': and then he overthrovvs all his fundamental assertions
With the exclamation: Et iqnoruncia huius metlzaplzisice de anima
fui eqo et forte alii mei similes plurimum eaececatus, sompniuns
quod anima et specialiter humana sit res, que poterit α corpore
separari. (J)

But these considerations have detained me longer than I
originally intended. I only wish to show that we have here rather
a conglomeration of various mutually destructive ideas, than a
consistently pursued argument: that Wielif does not attempt to
exhaust his material, but only to lay down a few leading principles3
—— that he is suggestive, rather than conclusive.

From the loose construction of the entire work, it is not
surprising to find that the refiections at the end. have very little
to do with the original subject, and that finally the treatise itself
abruptly breaks off.

Two MSS. of minor value add the words ‘Et sic est finis
tractatus de composicione hominis⁷ as if the scribes had sought in
vain for a conclusion.

In the best MSS. the treatise is not concluded‚ and the result
of all the internal evidence just now under consideration, is the
conviction that the ‘tractatus de composicione hominis’ is not α
literary work proceedin9 directly from Wicli'f’s pen, but that mere
