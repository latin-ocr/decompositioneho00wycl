XVm JNTRODUCTION.

Observations such as those on p. 74, 14 of course do not
help us.

On the whole, we may conjecture with some probability that
Wielif delivered his lectures, not indeed before the completion of
his studies, but just after obtaining his honourable post at Ballio]
College.

This took place ras we know) shortly before 1360.

It is possible and even likely, that Wiclif had planned and
collected material for this work before this date, but no proof of
this can be gleaned either from the work itself, or from other
sources.

All that is certain is, that the treatise as it stands is a product
of his professorial years, and therefore cannot be dated much
earlier than 1360.

VI. The intrinsie value of the treatise.

ln the last place, a few words must be said as to the intrinsic
inerit of the work, and of its value from the point of view of
Wiclifian research.

Reference has already been made to the impossibility‚ in the
present state of our literature, and that of the philosophical works
in particular, of gaining more than a partial view of Wiclif’s
intellectual position.

This difficulty presses the more heavily here, in that our
treatise is of almost exclusively philosophie interest. Any one reading
it in order to gain new light on Wiclif as reformer κατ’ ἐξοχήν will
bc disappointed.

The great turning point in Wiclif‘s views on the church‚ its
head and its inembers was yet far off at the time when our treatise
was written.

But if it be true that human development, like every other,
and in an eminent degree, is subject to the law of causation, this
work is not without its bearing upon that which it is Wielif’s great
distinction to have accomplished. The tract “de composicione'' does
not indeed show us how the reformer arose, but it is one amongst
the sources os our knowledge as to how he became a reformer.
