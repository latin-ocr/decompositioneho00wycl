XX INTRODUCTION.

conflict is always full of significance, and a great factor in intellec-
tual progress.

Such conflict is the peculiar heritage and privilege of the
Teutonic race3 and for this reason also the work before us is not
without value as being a monument of our national spirit.

In conclusion, it remains for me to fulfil the agreeable task
of thanking very heartily all those who have taken part in the
publication of this work.

My thanks are due in the first place to Professor Wilhelm
von Harte17 whom Ι beg kindly to accept the dedication of this
volume. In him Ι have the rare good fortune to find at once a
master, a teacher and a fatherly friend.

Ι owe to him my introduction to the leading members of the
Wiclif Society, and I have to thank him also for most valuable
help in my present undertaking. To the expression of my gratitude
Ι would add that of my hope that good work in the future may
result from the relation that exists between my venerated master
and myself.

The directors of the Prague University Library, and those of
the Vienna Imperial and Royal Library have materially aided me
by allowing me the use of MSS. Hofrath Dr. E. von Birk and
Scriptor Dr. Goedlin von Tiefenau in particular have given me
much help and encouragement in my work.

In the verification of some of the passages of Averroes I have
received very kind help from Professor Freudenthal of Breslau.

The consideration shown by the Committee of the Wiclif
Society for its editors is so well known and has been so often
experienced that it seems almost superfluous to allude to it here.

Nevertheless Ι cannot help expressing my own obligations to
the honoured Director of the Society, Dr. F. J. Furnivall7 for all
the assistance and encouragement he has given me during the last
five years. For corrections of the text of this edition and for the
translation of the side notes I am indebted to Mr. F. D. Matthew.

Madrid, Spring 1887.
