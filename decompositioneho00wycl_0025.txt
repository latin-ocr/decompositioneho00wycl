INTRODUCTION. XIX

We here catch sight of the vast philosophie substratum which
lies at the root of Wiolif's literary activsty, as of his intellectual
infiuence in general. The fulness and elearness with which this
philosophie basis displays itself is quite extraordinary in a work
of this compass.

At the same time the language is simple and direct, and 15
often character-ised by a touching warmth and sincerity, which
shows that the author did not aim at displaying his knowledge,
profound and extended as it was.

I have purposely made the index at the end as full as possible,
that Wiclif's great- erudition at this early period of his life may
be readily perceived.

The passages on anima, corpus, homo, form by themselves
almost a compendium of the anthropological science of those times.

The quotations from Scripture show a perfect familiarity with
the Bible: in Aristotle and his commentators, particularly Augustino,
Wielif he is versed beyond almost all his contemporaries.

But the admiration which this treatise calls forth in the
render, is not ,unmingled with a certain sense of disappointment.

Wiclif's feeling of the grandem· and sublimity of Holy Scrip-
ture was most enthusiastic: it is well known how in his early years
the future Doctor Evangelicus protested against the onesided pro-
minence accorded to the scholastic system, and it adds not a little
to the interest of our treatise that we find in it distinct traces of
this antagonism‚ ‘latendo ut- regsule tam verbis quam sensibus scripture
sacre canonica, he says at the very beginning.

But the endeavour to harmonize the Aristotelian psychology
with Christian dogma bears in itself the stamp of impossibility and
such an undertaking is doomed to failure from the first.

Wielif occasionally becomes conscious of this disagreement
and from this consciousness many a doubt results, to which also
he gives expression.

This conflict appears in our short pamphlet just as it does
in the great phases of the reformer's life.

WVhether it be one scientific principle that clashes with another,
whether it be, as later in Wiolif’s life, that dogma comes into
collision with a man’s own nobler intuitions, in either case the
