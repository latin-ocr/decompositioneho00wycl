INTRODUCTION. XVII

But as external evidence may easily rest upon a confusion —
a very interesting instance- of which has been brought forward by
ssuddensieg (De Christo et adv. suo Antichristo, separate edition
p. 21³), I prefer to rely mainly in questions of genuineness upon
interna] evidence.

Certainly this is a little difficult in the present case.

The controversial Oxford Professor, the reformer, the pope's
antagonist who appears so plainly in most of the other works, is
not, even by the most attentive reader, to be discovered here.

But if we treat the question psychologically -— if in the learn-
ing and the abundanee of ideas, common to the whole of Wielif’s
writings, we see evidence of a wide education3 if the proverbially
extensive biblical knowledge of the doctor evangelicus points to
early studies in this direction, if, lastly a manhood of strong and
sustained contliet implies a youth of earnestness and self-restraint,
then in every page of this work we see Wiclif before us.

VVhether we stand amazed at the accumulated stores of learn-
ing from every field of human knowledge, or marvel at the mastery
here displayed of the entire Bible, or admire the modesty evinced
is such a passage as that quoted already (34, 2), the same per-
sonality is before us,

As one cannot paint with words, so is it impossible by the
most elaborate argument to identify one writer with another.

But anyone who, with the author of the unquestionably genuine
vvorks before his mind, will carefully read through this treatise “de
composicione’', will discover and recognize his old acquaintance.

V. Date os composition.

In what has already been said, I have almost anticipated the
subject of this Section. In one word, we see before us the youthful
Wiclif fresh from the studies of the university3 their results are
still clear and vivid before his mind, but this accumulated material
has not yet been thoroughly digested and sifted.

Throughout the treatise We do not find a single historical

allusion, such as would enable us to fix its date with exaetness.
