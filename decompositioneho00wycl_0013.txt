INTRODUCTION VII

This Manuscript may be enriched by the following codices, of
inferior value in my opinion.

B. Codex of the Vienna Imperial and Royal Library.

On the valuable contents of this Ms. see Tab. ΙΙΙ 334 and
Denis Ι DCCCII.

This codex contains 274 leaves (size 1478 by 21,2 Centimeters)
parchment and paper from the XIII, XIV und XV Century. On
page 7'5—96a we find our treatise in a beautiful handwriting which
does not occur again in this codeX, and evidently dates from the
15th Century.

The third Codex C belongs likewise to the Vienna Imperial
and Royal Library Cod. 4504 [Theolog 932] (Tabulae III 290,
Denis I CCCLXXXVII paper XV Century (size 1474 by 21‚8 Centi-
meters). It contains on 153 leaves:

1. 1²²—36a Joh. Wiclif ‘Tractatus de simonia', 36b vacat.

2. :3721——110b Idem ‘De benedicta incarnatione‘.

3. nob—113b Idem ‘Sermo’ (super illud) probet autem se ipsum
homo’ and begins: ‘Quomodo Christianus ad ministrandum' 114b—1‘20b
left blank liuh—153b Idem ‘De composicione hominis’.

We have further used two Mss. of the Prague University
Library which we number P. and Pr.:

P VIII F 1. This codex is described in Hanslick's history and
description of the Prague University Library‚ Prague 1851, page 610.

It dates from the 15⁸1 Century and contains 1⁴20 leaves,
Hanslick states the number of leaves to be 113, which is explained
by pp. 114—120 not being paged. Size 15 by 22 Centimeters7 in
two columns. Its contents are:

1. 1—39 De universalibus-

2. 539—52 De materia et forma.

3. 53—73 De composicione hominis.

4. 73—87 De ideis.

5. 87--113 De individualite temporum.

At the end we find a pamphlet against priests, which may be
used as a terminus post quem. It runs thus:

‘Anno milleno quadrageno quoque deno

Luce sequenti post apa (erased) missionem Christi

Olim diviciis gravibusque dotata talentis)
