INTRODUCTION. XI

conscious only in the course of careful study of the MS. but which
then becomes plainly evident.

It appears in the headings and the dates so frequently given
by this scribe (compare our adnotatio critica and the description
of the MS. itself).

He does not overlook a single mistake3 he strikes out the
wrong word and adds the proper one.

It is this carefulness in the choice of the original and this
correctness in copying it which has determined my preference.

It would be futile, as Ι have said, to count up the readings,
numbers have no weight here, but one or two passages taken at
random will serve to confirm what has been stated.

Let us take the very beginning on page 1, 3 of O. P. Pr.:
partibus after suis is altogether impossible, for it is evident by the
following words cum aliis difficultatibus, that the author intended
to point out a difficulty3 but these words form the ‘principles' of
the composition.

A concrete part as such, cannot be spoken of as a diffi-
cultas.

It thus becomes clearer why the gloss ‘partibus' has been
smuggled in.

A scribe could only imagine a ‘composicio ἐπ’ partibus.

This mistake is old; we find it in all three MSS. and we know
that they do not copy one another, but it is the· more egregious
inasmuch as ‘6oe sais partibus qualitativi-3 principiis’ has no sense
at all.

A similar sentence we must pass on the following passage
where all the MSS. except A read ‘Primo materie possibilitas, pre-
ciositas sive subtilitas&

It is needless to say more on this passage3 for a discussion
of the ‘possibilitas’ of the composicio of man would be unheard of.

The two important points are the preciositas and the subtilitas
as will be explained by the following passage.

The passage 1, 15 ‘ut materiam de trinitate, cle incarnacione
verbi domini et cle beatitudinefinali', is interesting and a good specimen
of Wyclif’s style. The ‘et’ which introduces the last word is to be
found in A, only.
