4. The Society wants more money and more Editors.
Those few Members who have complaind of the small issues
of the Society, forget that nearly half their Subscriptions has
had 10 118 spent in copying (including Editors' journeys to
examine or collate MSS). The figures are as follows :-—-

Reasonable folk will see at once that with this great outlay on
copying—an outlay without which the Society could not have
moved a step—large issues of books have been impossible.
Moreover‚ Members must remember that over 16150 worth
of work done for them has been paid, not by them, but by the
Bishops' Fund (AEIOO), and by the other donations to the Society
which have amounted to 3855 133. The Committee cannot make

8 big job in hand, the payment of England’s debt to its great

are needed for this task, both 00 1118 part of Members in
general and the Society's Editors in particular. Much copying
of MSS. has still to be done. New Editors for some of

wanted. The preparation of a Wyclif MS. for press is no
easy matter, 88 Dr. Poole explaind in the Report for 1884,
and often takes years of the scanty leisure which an Editor

the money wanted for copying and printing; to pay their
own Subscriptions promptly‚ and eanvass all their friends
and acquaintances for more.
