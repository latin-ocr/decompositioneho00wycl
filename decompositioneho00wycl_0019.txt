INTRODUCTION. XIII

The Higher Criticism.

The so-called higher criticism tries to catch the spirit of a
work, to judge of its internal coherence‚ whether or not every
part of it proceeds from the author whose name it bears, to pro-
nounce on its scope and aim, to pass sentence on its litei-ary
excellence.

The allied general question of genuineness will be treated in
the following chapter.

Is the treatise de composicione hominis a systematic work?

Have the originals from which the treatise was compiled been
well digested and sisted, has a clear and definite plan been followed
in the composition?

All these questions we have to answer by a decisive No.
We will first examine the sources of the treatise‚ that is to say,
the ᾖον-εἴρῃ material used by Wiclif, and by him acknowledged to
be such, either explicitly, or by implication.

It is contrary to all that we know of Wiclif's character, and
cannot be proved of him, that he ever claims for himself the
intellectual property of another.

Such passages as 34, 2 ff: Sed ne videar επ ceo-ebro proprio
tam altam sentenciam ad tempus insolitum ventilare, ecce mayna
mayistri Auyustz'ni sentencialis et verbalis decisio ete„ are proof‚ not
only of Wielif's modesty but of the immense influence exercised
by the authority and the acknowledged credibility of the author,
on the formation and composition of the present treatise.

In accordance with this is the enormous number of quotations7
which are quite disproportionate to the length of the work.

In this treatise, which might very well by itself have occupied
forty pages, about hundred and fifty quotations‚ some very long, he
cites are introduced, making an average of nearly four to a page.

This disproportion is quite without parallel, so far as my
knowledge goes of the printed and MS. works of Wiclif.

As the citations form so important a part of the treatise, a
few words as to how I have dealt with them in editing the text7
may not be out of place.
