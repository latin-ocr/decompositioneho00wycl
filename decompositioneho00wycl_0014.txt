V111 INTRODUCTION.

‘Turma sacerdotum volebat rapere totum

Quod non habebat patruni universaque edebat

Nec parcit propriis, sed ea tribuit vagis famellis

Iam loculos ditata in alto loco locata

Mala paterna . . .’

Here the poem, itself not without interest as illustrating the
reformatory movement of that time, abruptly breaks off.

Our last textual authority is Pr. Codex Pragensis VIII, 9, 6,
bound in stout parchment, but written on pape1·‚ 110 pp. all in the
same hand (XV¹h Century): the writing is very indistinct and slo-
venly, rendering the collation of the MS. a matter of great difficulty.
This MS. contains:

1. Wiclif a) libellus de universalibus pp. 1—57.

b) Eiusdem de materia et forma pp. 57—80.

2. Positio Stephani de Palecz.

3. Positio Johannis de HussinetZ.

4. De Composicione hominis.

The second Treatise begins:

,Sequitur posicio Reverendi magistri Stephani PalecZ.'

The third treatise begins:

,Sequitur alia positio Reverendi Magistri de HusinecZ.⁷

11. Diplomatic Criticism.

There is no need to discuss at length in this place, what is
understood amongst recent scholars by the term ‘diplomatic criticism’.
It comprises the estimate of the documentary value of manuscript
sources, their classification and the determining of their relation
to one another, the construction of the text by this means3 and
lastly, the detailed study of particular passages. Here too it has
been possible to follow the lead of former editors.

But in thc first part of our task — the examination of the
comparative value of our authorities, —— wc are, in the present case,
bcset with difficulties at the outset.

As Buddensieg has conclusively proved, the principles which
guide us in the criticism of classical MSS. can bc applied equally
to late mediaeval MSS.
