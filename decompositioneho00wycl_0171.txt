1. Though only 0116 01 the books promist for 1886, namely,
De Benedicta Incarnacc'owe, edited by the Rev. Edwin Harris,
MA„ was issued during that year, yet the other, vol. i. of
Wyolif's Semnones, edited by Prof. J. Loserth‚ Ph.D., is all
printed, and will be sent to Members as soon as the sheets
reach England, and ean be bound. With it, will go out Mr.
Rudolf Beer’s edition of De Commo-sicione Hominis, which is
plso all printed, and which belongs to the Society's issue
or 1884.

The De Benedicta Incarnatc‘one is a work of Wyclif's middle
period (about 1365), purely scholastie in form, but very
characteristic, shewing that Wyclif was striving sor a
theology deeper and more satisfying than the distinctions
and definitions of the 66110016 could supply. It shews too
that Wyclif was already moving towards his final views
on the Eucharist‚ although he had not yet consciously broken
with the doctrine 01 Transubstantiation.

The De Conwosc'cz'one is one of Wyclif's early works, prob-
ably compiled by him 101 1116 scholastio lectures at Oxford.
The Sei-mons belong to the later period 01 the Reformer's
1116. Though some of them may have been compiled earlier,
60 early indeed as dum. stetit m scholis, yet Prof. Loserth
shows that Wyclif must have revised them, doubtless for
the use 01 1116 ‘Poor Priests‚' so late as the years 1381-82.
