XVI INTRODUCTION.

‘notes for lecturas formed the source of the work as it has come
down to us.

This conclusion must have been accepted, even had we no
further arguments to support it than those just given.

However this is happily not the case.

In the tractate itself a passage occurs, which would have no
meaning at all, except as spoken to a crowed audience in the
lecture-room of a university.

Wiclif says at the beginning of the fourth chapter (cf.
page 53, 19): quod communis scola hodie audiens loqui de anima vel
formis aliis quibuscunque concz'piv‘, ..... ideo premittenda est ratio
quiditatz's anime in communi.

On examination of the context it might perhaps be urged,
that the grammatical construction is defective, and that the readings

of the other MSS. are of doubtful authority.

But in the words communis scola hodie audiens all the MSS.
agree, and these words are sufficient to decide the matter.

We have evidently before us a treatise written down by some
scholar as it came from the Master's lips, a revision by Wielif
himself being of course out of the question.

Thus we have before us the living word with its merits and
its drawbacks alike.

No one can fail to observe in the work before us, the keen-
ness in argument, the power of expression, and sometimes even
an exaltation of style which is rare with Wiclif3 nor on the other
hand, that inequality and want of composition of which Ι have
spoken above.

IV. The Question of Genuineness.

Intimately connected with the critical investigation of our
trcatisc, is the question of its authenticity3 indeed, the latter may
almost be said to be included in the former.

External evidence for the genuineness of “de composicione''
has been carefully collected by Shirley and others.

The catalogues published by Buddensieg (Pol. W. I, LIX pp.)

may be referred to.
