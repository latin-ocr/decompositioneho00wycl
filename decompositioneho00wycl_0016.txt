X INTRODUCTION.

if discovered, would have given a clue to the history of the trans-
mission of the work.

In my opinion we have to deal with MSS. springing indeed
from the same original source but having no closer connexion with
one another.

The reason of the frequent references in the notes to all the
remaining MSS. B, C, P and Pr, is simply that in many cases, I
was bound to adopt one MS. as the basis of the text. This MS.
however certainly seemed to me to deserve the preference, and
for the following reasons.

In settling the text I aimed at a reasonable eclectz'cz'sm, such
as under similar circumstances is practised and sanctioned by the
most competent critics. Everyone who has entered, however slightly,
into the investigation of the ‘text of classical authors, is aware to
what an extent this method is followed, from the Metamorphoses
of Ovid, and almost throughout the whole series of lyrics.

In the same way with the other authors we are seldom able
to follow implicitly the guidance of one MS.

Applying this to our case, our first result is the negative one:
For the treatise ‘De Composicione’ we have — quite apart from the
sels-evident minor mistakes of scribes —— no authentic MS. to follow·

Our already expressed preference for MS. A is not inconsistent
with this fact.

Both for external and internal reasons, the superiority of this
MS. appears t0⁶ me of equal certainly with our negative dictum.

First and foremost, there is the comparatively clear, firm and
scholarly handwriting which can seldom be misi-ead, and which
contrasts favourably with the version Pr rt 445, 24, or countless
other MSS. which might he named. We have to acknowledge the
liberality of the Society in affording the members an opportunity
of judging for themselves of this first MS„ by means of the fac-
simile of its first page appended to the present volume.

Everyene who has had to ‹l0 with the recklessly careless
scribbling so common with 15ιιι Century scribes, will appreciatc
the evenness and firmness of this writing.

In addition to this good quality, there is a degree of
intelligence traceable in the copying itself, of which we become
