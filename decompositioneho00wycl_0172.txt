His attacks on the mendicant friars, the Pope, and the abuses
of the Romish Church, are full of individuality and interest,
while his outlines of what a true Priest, a true Bishop, and
0 true Church should be, show that his reforms were con-
structive as well as destructive.

2. For 1887, Prof. Loserth 1108 111 type part of the second
volume of Wyelif's Sermons, and hopes he may be able—
with Messrs. Fromme’s and Mr. Matthew's help —to finish it
by C} 1ristmas. The Committee trust that Members will supply
1110111 with money enough to enable a second volume to be issued
for the y ear, tho' peihaps not in it. This will no doubt be the
De (lfficzo Reffls (Book VIII of the Summa Tleeolofflae), edited
by Mr. W. A. Pollard, M. A. the Editor of Wy clif' 8 Dialoyus.
Dr. Reginald L. Poole hopes to get into type by the end
of 1887 the text of Wyclif’s De Dominio Divino, and go to

now working through the Treatise of which the first four
books will form the Appendix to his volume, the De Pauperie
Sala-aforis of Richard Fitz-Ralph‚ Archbishop of Armagh.
This has never yet been printed, but as Dr. Poole has found
that it throws great light on the genesis of Wyelif's special
views of Dominion, 110 1108 had the most important part of
it copied for the Society from 0 Bodleian manuscript, and is
now collating it with a manuscript at Merton College. If Dr.
Poole can finish his volume in 1888, it and the Third Part of
Wyclif's Sermons will form the Society's issue for 1888.

Mr. F. D. Matthew has been obliged to give all the time
11101 110 0011 spare the Society to writing the side-notes to
Prof. Loserth's volume and Mr. Beer's. He has more than
once broken down in the attempt to work at his own editions
of Wyclif's Miscellaneous Tracts and De stimulatis, so that
the appearance of these must be deferd till more leisure and
stronger health come to him.
