INTRODUCTION. IX

But it should not be overlooked that we possess MSS. of the
classics and even of the Fathers of the Church, and the historians of
the early middle ages, which, in point of clearness and accuracy,
are all that we could desire. ’

It should further be taken into account, that of most of
these authors we have a great many editions, and that these
favourable circumstances have not only fostered but even challenged
the study of MSS„ of their transmission, and more especially, of
the linguistic peculiarities of the authors.

By such studies the number of so-called loci ambigui, that
is to say, of passag‹1·s where it appears advisable to incorporate
various readings into the text, is reduced to a mininum. In the
case of a Wiolif edition, more particularly of an editio princeps, no
such advantage exists.

The editor feels himself bound to confess that in a great
number of passages the reading given in the note might just as
well have been incorporated into the text, and vice versa.

In such cases the scientific method which we have described,
demands that we should follow the best MS. i. e. that which in
undoubted instances has given the best readings. But which is
the best source of our present treatise? This is the question we
have presently to consider, a question intimately connected with
that of the classification of the MSS: a few words must therefore
first be said on this latter point.

But in this preliminary investigation, there being such a
disproportion between possible and undoubtedly correct readings,
wc find ourselves at once in a dilemma, or before a circulus
vitiosus, a very frequent occurrence throughout the study of this
treatise.

We have to decide which is the best source, and to base this
dccision on readings which for the most part are uncertain.

Again, it is not advisable on account of these circumstances,
to rely on the strength of numbers3 for the critical passages must
not be counted but ws-ighed.

The difficulties of dealing with the MSS. were increased by
my inability, despite the most careful examination, to discover
any family connexion between the five MSS. Such a connexion,
